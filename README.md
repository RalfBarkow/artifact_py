# Artifact-py: a reimagining of [artifact]

This is a reimplementation of [artifact]. It will be the barebones of artifact
necessary to put it in a build system. No featureful cli, no web-ui. Just
parsing and exporting of json/markdown/etc.

At the same time, this is not a strict rewrite. It is a reimagining and will probably guide
the development of artifact 3.0. The primary difference will be the use of the new
[anchor_txt] markdown attribute format, developed specifically for this project.
